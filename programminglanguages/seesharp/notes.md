C# (pronounced "See Sharp")

- Component-oriented: self-contained and self-describing packages of funcionality.
- Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.
- Exception handling by error detection and recovery
- Type-safe
- Unified type system: all the types (even the primatives) inherit from a single root object type.
