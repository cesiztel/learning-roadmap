# Learning roadmap

This is my software engineering learning roadmap. Here I will upload notes, code and a roadmap of all the things I am learning or I want to learn. This roadmap is made by me being aware of my own way of learning and my preferences. So, to be totally honest with the contributors, following some rules for this project:

- This is design by me. Dedication and progress will be up to me, so do not expect high level of commitment for contributors. 
- I do not expect contributions directly to my learning roadmap, but if you want to contribute with notes, add new programs, please feel free to create new PR's. 
- I am always open for discussions and suggestions, but due to this is really personal trip, I would like to experience myself and make my own mistake besides the opinions of other people.

The best way to contribute is fork/clone/download the project and create your own roadmap. You can reuse the content that I publish in this repo in the way suits you best.
