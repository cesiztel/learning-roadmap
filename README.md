# üë®‚Äçüè´ Learning roadmap

This is my software engineering learning roadmap. Here I will upload notes, code and a roadmap of all the things I am learning or I want to learn. This roadmap is made by me being aware of my own way of learning and my preferences. 

If you are interested in the material that I push here, please be aware of the following things:

- This is design by me. Dedication and progress will be up to me, so it will be at my own pace. 
- I do not expect contributions directly to my learning roadmap, but if you want to contribute with notes, add new programs, please feel free to create new PR's. 
- I am always open for discussions and suggestions, but due to this is really personal trip, I would like to experience myself and make my own mistake besides the opinions of other people. So, please do not get offended if I do not follow your suggestions.

I think you can get benefit from this repository basically in two ways: fork/clone/download the project and create your own roadmap or just visit all the resources that I will be pushing. 

Happy learning!
