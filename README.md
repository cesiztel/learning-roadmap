# üë®‚Äçüè´ Learning roadmap

This is my software engineering learning roadmap. Here I will upload learning material, code exercises and experiments doing while learning. The content pushed is based on my own way of learning and my personal preferences. 

Please, take in account following aspects while checking the content:
 
I think you can get benefit from this repository basically in two ways: 
- Direct contributions are not expected. If you want to contribute, consider the following ways: create new PR's or fork the project and make your own roadmap thing out of it.
- Read the content, think about it yourself, experiment and finally put it in practice. 

# üí™ Learning techniques.

Over the years I've been thinking and reading a lot about learning and how to learn. I would like to share some of the techniques that I collected.

1. Start with "why" you really want to learn a new skill. Some questions you can answer for yourself:
    - What am I curious about? And what would I like to understand better?
    - How would I like to challenge myself by learning something new?
    - What is important to me about learning X,Y,Z?
    - How does learning X, Y, Z relate to other things I'd like to achieve in my work/life/relationships with others?
    - In what ways will learning X, Y, Z allow me to feel more confident / better equipped for my work / life / relationships with others?
    - How could I use my new learning knowledge or skills to help other people / contribute to new project?
    - How does learning X, Y, Z help me to feel more in control of choices I make around my work / my environment / other aspects of my life?
    - How might my accomplishments in learning X, Y, Z be recognized by others?

2. Set clear learning goals about what you're planning to learn using S.M.A.R.T goals technique:
    - S  ‚áí can be explained in one sentence
    - M  ‚áí easily measurable.
    - A  ‚áí low the bar. Build up the habit.
    - R  ‚áí relevant link with "why".
    - T  ‚áí timely. Try to split if it's too big. In weeks? 4-week plan. 8-weeks plan.

3. Structure your time & schedule your learning sessions.

4. Apply what you learn by building you own digital portfolio / applications.

5. Track progress, study sessions. 

6. [Optional] Use the "up to 3" technique:
    - Choose one skill you want to learn for your work.
    - Choose one skill you want to learn for your long view of your professional career.
    - Choose one skill you want to learn for your personal interest.

7. Use "The Feyman Tachnique". If you want to supercharge your learning, the single most effective technique we‚Äôve uncovered for absorbing new concepts comes from the famed Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.¬†[The Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) ensures you understand what you learn. It includes the following four steps:
    - Choose a concept you wish to learn about.
    - Pretend you are teaching it to a child‚Äîa sixth-grader, specifically. Write your explanation down or say it out loud.
    - Identify any gaps in your understanding that might show up when you try to simplify the concept; go back to the source material to find the information you need.
    - Review and simplify your explanation again.


Happy learning!

# Topics

## Computer Science foundations

### Programming 

I decided go over coding fundamentals and prepare myself like if I have to do a coding interviews. I do not have a coding interview ahead, so I can slow my learning down and stop in concepts that I think are really important to learn and understand deeply. Other of my goals is try to explain coding concepts in plain words. Being aware of my limitations for the abstract thinking I want to make myself the way to improve this aspect describing computer science concepts in really simple way or at least as simple as possible. I want to obtain a better understanding of certain concepts and I believe that when you understand a concept truly sticks in your memory more time.

ü¶æ Goals for programming:

- [ ] Read the first 3 Chapters of the book: [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

## Programming language

- [C#](/c#)

## Containers

- [Docker commands](/containers/docker/COMMANDS.md). Collection of useful commands for docker.

## API

- [GraphQL initial tutorial](/api/graphql/README.md). Introduction tutorial explaining basic concepts of GraphQL

## AWS

### AWS Step Functions

- [AWS Step Functions sample](/aws/stepfunctions). Sample about how to use AWS Step Functions
- [How to: AWS Step Functions and Amazon State Language](https://cesarcodecrafter.com/step-functions-and-state-language/). Article that I wrote about AWS Step Functions.
