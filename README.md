# üë®‚Äçüè´ Learning roadmap

This is my software engineering learning roadmap. Here I will upload notes, code and roadmaps about all the things I am currently learning or I want to learn. This content repository is based on my own way of learning and my preferences. 

If you are interested in the material that I push here, take in consideration the following things:
 
- I do not expect contributions directly to this learning repository, but if you want to contribute with notes, resources, add new programs, please feel free to create new PR's or fork the project and make your own roadmap thing out of it.
- I am always open for discussions and suggestions, but due to this is really personal trip, I would like to experience myself and make my own mistake besides the opinions of other people. So, please do not get offended if I do not follow your suggestions.

I think you can get benefit from this repository basically in two ways: 
- Fork/clone/download the project and create your own roadmap.
- Just visit all the resources that I will push on this repository. 

# üí™ Learning techniques.

Over the years I was thinking a lot about learning, reading about how to learn and techniques that could offer me a new ways of learning. Here I would like to share some of the techniques and thoughts that collected.

1. Start with why you really want to learn a new skill.
    - What am I curious about? And what would I like to understand better?
    - How would I like to challenge myself by learning something new?
    - What is important to me about learning X,Y,Z?
    - How does learning X, Y, Z relate to other things I'd like to achieve in my work/life/relationships with others?
    - In what ways will learning X, Y, Z allow me to feel more confident / better equipped for my work / life / relationships with others?
    - How could I use my new learning knowledge or skills to help other people / contribute to new project?
    - How does learning X, Y, Z help me to feel more in control of choices I make around my work / my environment / other aspects of my life?
    - How might my accomplishments in learning X, Y, Z be recognized by others?

2. Set clear learning goals about what you're planning to learn using S.M.A.R.T goals technique
    - S  ‚áí can be explained in one sentence
    - M ‚áí easily measurable.
    - A  ‚áí low the bar. Build up the habit.
    - R  ‚áí relevant link with "why".
    - T  ‚áí timely. Try to split if it's too big. In weeks? 4-week plan. 8-weeks plan.

3. Structure your time & schedule your learning sessions.

4. Apply what you learn by building you own digital portfolio / applications.

5. Track progress, study sessions. 

6. [Optional] Use the "up to 3" technique:
    - Choose one skill you want to learn for your work.
    - Choose one skill you want to learn for your long view of your professional career.
    - Choose one skill you want to learn for your personal interest.

7. Use "The Feyman Tachnique". If you want to supercharge your learning, the single most effective technique we‚Äôve uncovered for absorbing new concepts comes from the famed Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.¬†[The Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) ensures you understand what you learn. It includes the following four steps:
    - Choose a concept you wish to learn about.
    - Pretend you are teaching it to a child‚Äîa sixth-grader, specifically. Write your explanation down or say it out loud.
    - Identify any gaps in your understanding that might show up when you try to simplify the concept; go back to the source material to find the information you need.
    - Review and simplify your explanation again.


Happy learning!
