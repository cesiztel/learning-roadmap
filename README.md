# üë®‚Äçüè´ Learning roadmap

This is my software engineering learning roadmap. Here I will upload notes, code and roadmaps about all the things I am currently learning or I want to learn. This content repository is based on my own way of learning and my preferences. 

If you are interested in the material that I push here, take in consideration the following things:

- This is design by me.  
- I do not expect contributions directly to this learning repository, but if you want to contribute with notes, resources, add new programs, please feel free to create new PR's or fork the project and make your own thing out of it.
- I am always open for discussions and suggestions, but due to this is really personal trip, I would like to experience myself and make my own mistake besides the opinions of other people. So, please do not get offended if I do not follow your suggestions.

I think you can get benefit from this repository basically in two ways: fork/clone/download the project and create your own roadmap or just visit all the resources that I will be pushing. 

Happy learning!
